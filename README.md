# Zerotab

Zerotab is a retro synthwave startpage created by ZeroAlpha.
It is a modified copy of [WebOasis](http://weboas.is), for personal use only.
Modifications include the logo, background, links/bookmarks, and some functionality.

All credit goes to WebOasis.

The `generate_links_count.rb` script can be run with Ruby to update the links count in the JSON file (so that you don't have to do it manually).

Links can be tested by the hundred at [HTTP Status Code Checker](https://httpstatus.io).
